- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Lexiloop, Lexi for friends!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in html code to create easy and customizable games.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use different websites like GitHub and also learning a bit of programming to improve my games and allow people to play them on my websites.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I don't know what I'm doing tbh and English is not my first language so I make mistakes while programming very often hahah
- ...Soooo if you are kind enough to take a moment and give me some advice I'll appreciate it a daaamn lot.
